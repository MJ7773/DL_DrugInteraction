# Deep Learning project : find the best model to predict drug pair interactions

In the modern age with the rapid development and improvement in the medical area patients are frequently taking multiple different medicines at a time expecting its synergy due to either complexity of their disease or the medicine mechanism. It is efficient for sure if utilizing them appropriately through doctorâ€™s prescription, but people often autonomously mix and take them simply based on their symptom with leftovers from the last prescriptions or from drug stores (non-prescription needed drugs). Those cases can cause several problems and it sometimes even goes serious. In the worst case of drug interaction it can occur a death penalty but also overdose or reduce their individual expected effects, even entirely ineffective. Including those reasons, pharmaceutical companies are actively experimenting to discover drug-drug interaction cases to efficiently prescribe medicines to recover symptoms and avoid bad effects. 

In this project, we aimed to compare several machine learning models to observe which is the best for distinguishing if a certain pair has bad effects or not. We aim to discover the most effective model that can be used to experiment drug-drug interactions.
